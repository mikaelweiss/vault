## Official Apple
There’s a WWDC Mac and iPhone app. One thing I’ve done that’s really fun and that I feel helps a bunch is you go through the WWDC videos and favorite any where the title sounds interesting and then watch it like a tutorial following along.

I read through the Swift Docs at one point. You can get it on Apple Books and then mark it up.
