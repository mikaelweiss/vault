## The "I don't have time" conundrum
This happens to me every semester of school.
**Trigger:** I get excited about working on Strive
**Response:** I spend too much time throughout the week working on Strive instead of homework and work
**Reward:** I'm stuck working on homework 'till late into the night on Saturday

^^^ That's the trigger for this next one.
**Trigger:** ^
**Response:** I focus on doing nothing but homework and work the next week
**Reward:** I'm _still_ stuck doing homework and work late into the night on Saturday

^^^ That's the trigger for this next one.
**Trigger:** ^
**Response:** I decide to budget 30 minutes to 1 hour each day to work on Strive
**Reward:** I get all my homework done and still get to work on Strive

### Why this is confusing
This is such a weird thing to me. If I say that I'm going to start off by doing my homework and then work on Strive on the weekend if I have time, then I will _always_ not have enough time to work on Strive on the weekend.
If I work on it throughout the week, then I will _always_ still have enough time to do all my homework and work.
I just don't understand how that works sometimes
### Sand, rocks, and pebbles
When we make time for what we care about most, then everything else falls in to place.
Start by filling a jar with sand, then pebbles, then rocks. It does not all fit.
Fill the jar first with rocks, then pebbles, then sand. It all fits.
Based on this, homework and work would both qualify as "sand" while working on Strive would be a "rock", but that doesn't make sense to me.
